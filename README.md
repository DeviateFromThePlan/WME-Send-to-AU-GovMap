## Current State Compatability:

QLD: ❌ - It is hosted on an GIS server, so possible if we constructed the layers ourself. The QldGlobe team confirmed they don't support this, however I wonder if I could submit a feature request.

NSW: ✅

VIC: ✅

NT: ❌ - We don’t know if there is a way to inject coordinates into the link, or whether it is GIS, so unlikely to get support (but not impossible!).

WA: ❌ - It is just a GIS server, but it seems to be handling different to the rest. There is potential for it to be added in the future however.

ACT: ❌ - GIS server is currently a 404.

TAS: ❌ - Haven’t looked yet, but it looks like a GIS so probably coming soon!

SA: ✅
